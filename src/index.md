    <h1>From Sputnik to Starlink: A Data-Driven History of Satellites</h1>
    <p>
    The history of satellite launches spans nearly seven decades, beginning with the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, the first artificial satellite in human history. In the decades that followed, the United States and the USSR dominated orbital launches, driven primarily by military and scientific competition during the Cold War.
The dataset used here, via <a href="https://www.ucs.org/resources/satellite-database" target="_blank">Satellite Database | Union of Concerned Scientists</a>,  begins in 1974, well after the first recorded launch. The early entries are sparse—only one satellite launch recorded in 1974, followed by a long gap until 1988—reflecting incomplete coverage, not a true absence of launches. We also notice incomplete coverage in the later years; however, once more continuous data begins, we can analyze the trends to uncover global technological, economic, and geopolitical developments.

  <h3> Slow and Steady Growth (1988 - Early 2000s)
</h3>
  <p>
   From the late 1980s into the mid-2000s, satellite launches increased gradually across the world. Improvements in electronic size reduction, lower launch costs, and growing commercial demand all contributed to this steady rise. The number of satellites launched per year slowly climbed from 1–3 launches per year in the late 1980s (display some launches from the late 1980s here, with color code by country?)
to 17 by 1997 (show 1997 data)
to around 20–30 launches per year by the early 2000s. (show 2005 or 2006 data) 
Why did this happen? A key driver of this period was the communications boom. Companies and governments began deploying satellites for television broadcasting and early mobile networks, among other use cases. According to Via Satellite’s (<a href="https://interactive.satellitetoday.com/via-satellite-at-30-the-1990s-and-early-2000s/" target="_blank">Via Satellite at 30: The 1990s and Early 2000s - Via Satellite</a>)  retrospective analysis of the 1990s and early 2000s, demand especially surged in Asia, where rapidly developing economies invested heavily in telecommunications infrastructure. Some prolific operators from this period include: Eutelesat (Europe), Inmarsat (UK), AsiaSat (Hong Kong), IntelSat (more global).

  <h3 style="font-weight: 800;">U.S. vs. Rest of World Launches</h3>
  <p>
    For most years up to around 1990, the United States accounted for 100% of launches in the available data. But this changed in the mid-1990s and especially after the year 2000.
The percent of launches by “Rest of World” (i.e. all countries except the US) climbed from 
0–30% in the early 1990s (show 1995 4 satellite launches, color coded by US and other?)
 to 50–65% in the early 2000s (show 2002 data color coded by country) 
to 81% in 2014 (117 launches, will need to use some method to not show all orbits

This shift reflects the rise of satellite programs in Europe, Russia, China, Japan, and India, among others, and the wider commercialization of space. The United States remained a major player, but by the late 1990s and early 2000s, many other countries were actively contributing to global satellite deployment.
This diversification of countries was driven by a few factors, including expanded commercial telecommunications, the growth of national, government-funded space programs, and lower launch costs as technologies advanced.

  <h3>U.S. vs. China: 2008–2020 A Satellite Competition
 </h3>
  <p>
   One particularly interesting trend began around 2008, when Chinese launch activity increased enough to draw direct comparison to U.S. activity.
  <h4>Selected U.S. vs China Annual Satellite Counts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>2007 — USA: 21, China: 1</li>
  <li>2008 — USA: 12, China: 9</li>
  <li>2009 — USA: 15, China: 6</li>
  <li>2010 — USA: 20, China: 17</li>
  <li>2011 — USA: 26, China: 15</li>
  <li>2012 — USA: 21, China: 23</li>
  <li>2013 — USA: 24, China: 13</li>
  <li>2014 — USA: 22, China: 21</li>
</ul>

By the mid-2010s, the two countries were launching comparable numbers of satellites each year. This trend is supported by analyses on Chinese military/government strategies (<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-space-strategy-and-developments?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">China Space Strategy and Developments</a>), which note that China and the U.S. entered a kind of strategic orbital competition, expanding their presence in space for communication, Earth observation, and national security.
A similar trend is visible in the number of satellites sent with a military purpose– both the U.S. and China show significant increases in military satellite launches throughout the 2010s, reflecting increased focus on intelligence-gathering, navigation systems, and surveillance assets.

  <h3> A Star-like Explosion (2017–2023) </h3>
  <p>
    After decades of gradual growth, the number of satellites launched suddenly skyrocketed:
2016: 107 satellites

2017: 221

2018: 308

2019: 272

2020: 1,054

2021: 1,590

2022: 2,113

2023: 909

This dramatic increase does not reflect more countries building satellites—it reflects a single tectonic shift in the industry:
The rise of mega-constellations, in particular SpaceX Starlink.
Beginning in 2020, SpaceX began launching 50–60 satellites per mission, sometimes completing multiple launches per month. This effectively rewrote the scale of global satellite activity. (<a href="https://spacenews.com/spacex-passes-2000-starlink-satellites-launched)" target="_blank">SpaceX passes 2,000 Starlink satellites launched - SpaceNews</a>)
To illustrate:
Starlink alone has launched over 5,000 satellites, more than every other country combined.

In 2022, the U.S. accounted for ~86% of all satellites launched (1664 )—almost entirely because of Starlink.

The global satellite count doubled in less than three years.

Other companies also began building constellations (e.g., OneWeb, Amazon’s Kuiper, Planet), but none approached Starlink’s scale.
Because of Starlink, annual global launch numbers went from hundreds to thousands almost overnight. These numbers are not slowing down either, with one article stating that, “Industry experts project that by the end of 2025, global satellite launches could exceed 3,000, marking an unprecedented annual milestone.” (<a href="https://orbitaltoday.com/2025/06/16/satellite-launches-soar-to-record-levels-in-2025-as-new-players-join-the-race/" target="_blank">Record-Breaking 1,200+ Satellites Launched in 2025</a>).

  <h3> Conclusion </h3>
  <p>
    From the launch of Sputnik in 1957 to the mega-constellations of the 2020s, the satellite industry has progressed from isolated scientific experiments to mass-produced commercial infrastructure. The data from 1974–2023 reflects:
Early slow growth as technology matured

A commercial boom during the 1990s and 2000s

Global diversification of launch capability

U.S.– China ‘competition’ during the 2010s

A transformational explosion in the 2020s due to reusable rockets and mega-constellations– Starlink

These patterns align closely with documented developments in global communications, international government space programs, and earth observation.
